# Hey, I'm Anukul 👋

**I build. I break. I learn. I repeat.**  
*Jack of all trades — master of building.*

At 21, I’ve tried almost everything —  
startups, hackathons, design, content creation, code, leadership, sleepless nights,  
wins, failures, experiments, and constant reinvention.  

Still not giving up.  
Still building.  
Still challenging every day.  

Somewhere between coding sprints and hackathon nights,  
I also tried trading — and lost it all to option trading (character development, I guess).
